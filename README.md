This version is specifically tailored for projects run in Jupyter Notebook and emphasizes the interactive and iterative nature of the environment. 

This project is a system using Python to manage buses on Route 18 in London. 
It uses real-time passenger information to change the number of buses during peak and off peak hours, which makes service efficient and reduces crowding. 
At busy hours, buses arrive every 10 minutes; during off peak hours, every 15 minutes. 

A main part is using data visualization to look at passenger trends. 
The insights are put back into the system to make it more accurate and help with decisions.


**Features**
The system simulates passenger counts, calculates average occupancy, and dynamically adjusts bus numbers based on demand. 
It includes a data visualization module to graphically represent trends in passenger flow, bus allocation, and occupancy. 
These visualizations help optimize scheduling and improve resource allocation. 
Insights from the visualization are incorporated into the database, creating a feedback loop that refines future predictions and operations.
